üîπ Explanation for revision:

- 'isLoading' variable is declared only once in the parent class (AuthState).
- All child classes (like AuthStateLoggedIn, AuthStateLoggedOut, etc.)
  share and use the SAME 'isLoading' variable from the parent ‚Äî not a new one.
- In the child constructor, we pass 'isLoading' to the parent using 'super(isLoading: isLoading)'.
  This means we‚Äôre just giving the value to the parent‚Äôs variable, not creating a new one.
- When an object is created:
    1Ô∏è‚É£ Parent constructor (AuthState) runs first ‚Üí sets 'isLoading'.
    2Ô∏è‚É£ Then child constructor runs ‚Üí sets its own extra variables.
- This helps all states have a common 'isLoading' property,
  so UI or Bloc can easily check 'state.isLoading' for any state type.
